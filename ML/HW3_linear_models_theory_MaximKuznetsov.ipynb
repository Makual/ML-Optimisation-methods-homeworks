        "\n",
        "This assignment contains two problems and several separate questions. It is aimes to assess your knowledge of linear models and resampling. If you feel unsure about this assignment, read chapters 1-5 of the [ISLP textbook](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf.download.html), review lecture slides or seminar materials of our course, or ask us during office hours or in TG chat.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment involves writing formulas and mathematical calculations. Calculations in python or on a calculator are not allowed! Therefore, please create only text cells in this Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Assessment and penalties\n",
        "Each of the tasks has a certain “cost” (indicated in (*italic* ) near the task). The maximum allowable grade for this assignment is **15 points**.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may not turn in an assignment after a strict deadline. In case of assigning an incomplete grade for a task due to errors, the reviewer has the opportunity to correct the work under the conditions specified in the response letter.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assignment is completed independently. “Similar” solutions are considered plagiarism and all students involved (including those who have been copied from) cannot receive more than 0 points for it. If you have found a solution to any of the assignments (or part of it) in an open source, you must provide a link to that source (most likely you will not be the only one who found it, so to exclude suspicion of plagiarism, a link to the source is required).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you used a generative model for finding a solution, you need to provide the link to the service used (browser verion, tg bot, etc.), network name, the prompt(s) used and how you evaluate the performance of this model. Without this reflection the home assignment won't be graded.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Format of submission\n",
        "Assignments are submitted through the Smart LMS system. You should send a notebook with the completed assignment. Name the notebook itself in the format **HW3-linear-models-theory-NameLastname.ipynb**, where Name and Lastname are your first and last name. If you wish to submit handwritten homework, you may do so by scanning (photographing) it in good quality and sending it in **PDF** format (using name convention **HW3-linear-models-theory-NameLastname.pdf**). But please note that documents of poor quality or written in illegible handwriting will not be accepted. Therefore, the recommended format is **IPYNB** with text cells. You can also send us PDFs created in other systems (Google Docs, LaTeX).\n",
